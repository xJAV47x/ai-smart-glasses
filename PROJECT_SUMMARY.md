## Important Notes

### Research Purpose
This project is designed for **research and prototype development purposes only**. All facial recognition and OSINT capabilities use only publicly available data sources to ensure legal compliance.

### Legal Compliance
The legal compliance framework has been designed with strict adherence to GDPR, CCPA, and emerging AI regulations. However, it should be reviewed by qualified legal counsel before implementation.

### Ethical Considerations
The project is built on principles of:
- **Privacy First:** Local processing, user control, data minimization
- **Transparency:** Clear communication about data usage
- **Fairness:** Continuous bias mitigation and monitoring
- **Accountability:** Regular audits and transparency reports
