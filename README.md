# AI Smart Glasses Project

This repository contains the design, architecture, and eventual code for a budget-friendly AI Smart Glasses project with advanced capabilities.

## Project Goal

To develop a prototype of AI Smart Glasses offering real-time visual overlays, facial recognition, object recognition, OSINT integration, and a 'Jarvis-like' AI assistant experience. The project emphasizes cost-effectiveness for prototyping and future productization, while ensuring legal compliance and ethical data handling.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time Visual Overlays:** Google Maps-like navigation, contextual information display.
*   **Facial Recognition:** Real-time identification using public data sources, including name and potential workplace.
*   **Object Recognition:** Identification and contextual information for objects.
*   **AI Assistant (Jarvis-like):** Voice-controlled interaction, daily task management, personalized guidance.
*   **OSINT Capabilities:** Integration with open-source intelligence for enhanced context.
*   **Manus AI Integration:** Leveraging advanced AI agent capabilities.
*   **Budget-Friendly Design:** Optimized for cost-effective prototyping and scalable for commercialization.
*   **Legal & Ethical Compliance:** Designed with strict adherence to data privacy and usage laws, particularly for facial recognition using public data.

## Architecture Overview

The system comprises a pair of AR glasses connected to a powerful, yet compact, edge AI compute unit. This modular design allows for flexible component selection and easy upgrades.

### Hardware

*   **AR Glasses:** Rokid Max Pro + Rokid Station (recommended for prototype balance of features and cost).
*   **Edge AI Compute Unit:** NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit (for high-performance AI inference).
*   **Connectivity:** Bluetooth LE, Wi-Fi, Tailscale VPN for secure communication.
*   **Power:** High-capacity USB-C power banks.

### Software

*   **Operating Systems:** Ubuntu Linux (Edge AI), Android (AR Glasses companion app).
*   **Core AI Modules:**
    *   **Facial Recognition:** YOLOv8 (detection), ArcFace/FaceNet (embedding), Faiss (matching).
    *   **Object Recognition:** YOLOv8, CLIP.
    *   **OSINT Integration:** Python libraries for web scraping (with caution), public APIs.
*   **AI Assistant:** Speech-to-Text (Whisper), Text-to-Speech (Google TTS), Local LLM (Llama 3/Mistral 7B) for privacy and cost, Cloud LLM (Manus AI, OpenAI API) for advanced tasks.
*   **Data Management:** Local SQLite/PostgreSQL database for user data, embeddings, tasks, and OSINT caches.
