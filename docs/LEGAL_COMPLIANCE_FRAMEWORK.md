## AI Smart Glasses Project

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Author:** Manus AI  
**Status:** Framework for Prototype Development

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document establishes the legal compliance and data protection framework for the AI Smart Glasses project, with particular emphasis on facial recognition and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) capabilities. The framework is designed to ensure that all operations comply with applicable data protection laws, ethical AI principles, and responsible innovation standards while maintaining the technical and commercial viability of the prototype.

The framework operates on a fundamental principle: **all facial recognition and OSINT data will be sourced exclusively from publicly available, legally accessible sources**. This approach significantly reduces legal complexity while maintaining the core functionality of the product.

## 2. Applicable Legal Frameworks

### 2.1 European Union: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The GDPR applies to any organization processing personal data of EU residents, regardless of where the organization is located. For the AI Smart Glasses project, GDPR compliance is essential.

**Key Requirements for Facial Recognition:**

The GDPR treats biometric data (including facial recognition data) as a special category of personal data requiring enhanced protection [1]. Processing such data is generally prohibited unless one of the specific legal bases applies:

*   **Explicit Consent:** The data subject must provide clear, informed, and freely given consent for facial recognition processing. This is the most straightforward approach for consumer applications.
*   **Legitimate Interests:** Organizations may process biometric data based on legitimate interests, provided they conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and the processing is proportionate.
*   **Legal Obligation:** Processing may be necessary to comply with legal obligations.
*   **Vital Interests:** Processing may be necessary to protect vital interests.

**Data Subject Rights Under GDPR:**

Data subjects have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, and port their personal data. For facial recognition systems, this means users must be able to request deletion of their facial embeddings and associated data [1].

**Transparency and Accountability:**

Organizations must provide clear privacy notices explaining how facial data is collected, processed, and used. A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is mandatory for high-risk processing, including facial recognition.

### 2.2 United States: California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

The CCPA applies to for-profit entities that collect personal information from California residents and meet certain thresholds (annual revenue exceeding $25 million, or collecting data from 100,000+ residents/households) [2].

**Key Requirements:**

*   **Right to Know:** Consumers have the right to know what personal information is collected.
*   **Right to Delete:** Consumers can request deletion of personal information collected from them.
*   **Right to Opt-Out:** Consumers can opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information.
*   **Right to Non-Discrimination:** Businesses cannot discriminate against consumers for exercising their CCPA rights.

**Facial Recognition Implications:**

While the CCPA does not explicitly prohibit facial recognition, it requires transparency about its use and provides consumers with rights over their data. The California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which amends the CCPA, provides additional protections and stricter requirements [2].

### 2.3 State-Level Facial Recognition Laws

As of 2024, fifteen U.S. states have enacted laws limiting police use of facial recognition, with increasingly strong guardrails [3]. While most focus on law enforcement, some have broader implications:

*   **Massachusetts:** Restricts use of facial recognition by law enforcement without a warrant.
*   **Illinois:** Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) requires explicit consent before collecting biometric data, including facial recognition.
*   **Texas:** Restricts use of facial recognition by law enforcement.

For a prototype intended for consumer and professional use, compliance with the strictest state laws (particularly Illinois BIPA) is advisable.

### 2.4 Council of Europe: Guidelines on Facial Recognition

The Council of Europe has published guidelines on facial recognition that apply to member states [4]. Key recommendations include:

*   Detailed explanation of specific use and intended purpose.
*   Minimum reliability and accuracy of algorithms used.
*   Retention duration for facial data.
*   Regular audits and impact assessments.

## 3. Data Collection and Processing Strategy

### 3.1 Public Data Sources Only

To minimize legal complexity and ensure ethical compliance, the AI Smart Glasses project will utilize **exclusively publicly available data sources** for facial recognition and OSINT operations.

**Approved Public Data Sources:**

| Data Category | Source | Legal Status | Use Case |
| :------------ | :----- | :----------- | :------- |
| **Facial Images** | Public social media profiles (LinkedIn, Twitter, public Instagram) | Public domain | Facial recognition training and matching |
| **Facial Images** | News articles and public media | Public domain | Facial recognition for public figures |
| **Facial Images** | Government databases (public records, mugshots where legal) | Public domain | Facial recognition for public figures |
| **Professional Information** | LinkedIn public profiles | Public domain | Workplace and professional affiliation |
| **Business Information** | Company websites, public directories | Public domain | Organizational context |
| **News and Events** | Public news archives, press releases | Public domain | Contextual information |
| **Geographic Data** | Google Maps, OpenStreetMap | Public domain with attribution | Location-based information |
| **Public Records** | Court records, property records (where public) | Public domain | Contextual information |

**Prohibited Data Sources:**

*   Private social media accounts or content.
*   Data obtained through unauthorized scraping of protected content.
*   Surveillance footage or CCTV recordings (unless explicitly authorized).
*   Medical or health records.
*   Financial records or credit information.
*   Any data obtained through hacking or unauthorized access.
*   Data subject to copyright or intellectual property restrictions.

### 3.2 Facial Recognition Data Handling

**Data Minimization:**

The system will store only the minimum necessary data for core functionality:

*   Facial embeddings (mathematical representations of facial features, not the original images).
*   Associated metadata (name, professional affiliation, source URL).
*   Timestamps of data collection.
*   User interaction logs (for improvement purposes only).

Original facial images will not be stored in the system; only embeddings will be retained.

**Data Retention Policy:**

*   Facial embeddings will be retained for a maximum of 12 months.
*   Users can request immediate deletion of their facial data.
*   Automatic purging of embeddings older than 12 months will occur monthly.
*   Deletion logs will be maintained for audit purposes.

**Encryption and Security:**

*   All facial embeddings will be encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption.
*   Data in transit will be protected using TLS 1.3 or higher.
*   Access to facial data will be restricted to authorized system components only.
*   Regular security audits will be conducted quarterly.

### 3.3 OSINT Data Handling

**Data Collection Standards:**

OSINT data will be collected exclusively from publicly available sources and will adhere to the terms of service of all data sources:

*   Web scraping will respect `robots.txt` directives and rate limits.
*   API usage will comply with terms of service and rate limits.
*   News aggregation will respect copyright and attribution requirements.
*   Public records access will comply with applicable freedom of information laws.

**Data Aggregation and Anonymization:**

*   OSINT data will be aggregated to provide contextual information without identifying individuals unnecessarily.
*   Where possible, data will be anonymized or pseudonymized.
*   Direct personal identifiers will be minimized in stored data.

**Data Retention for OSINT:**

*   OSINT cache data will be retained for a maximum of 30 days.
*   Frequently accessed data may be retained longer (up to 90 days) with explicit user consent.
*   Users can request deletion of OSINT data at any time.

## 4. User Consent and Transparency

### 4.3 Accessibility and Language

Privacy notices and consent mechanisms will be provided in clear, accessible language appropriate to the target audience. For international deployment, translations will be provided for major markets.

## 5. Bias Mitigation and Algorithmic Accountability

### 5.1 Bias Assessment

Facial recognition algorithms can exhibit bias based on demographic characteristics (race, gender, age). The project will implement measures to identify and mitigate bias:

**Pre-Deployment Assessment:**

*   Evaluate facial recognition models on diverse datasets representing different demographic groups.
*   Measure accuracy rates across demographic categories.
*   Identify and document any significant disparities in accuracy.
*   Select models with the best performance across all demographic groups.

**Post-Deployment Monitoring:**

*   Continuously monitor system performance across demographic groups.
*   Collect user feedback on misidentifications or bias concerns.
*   Conduct quarterly bias audits.
*   Publish annual transparency reports on bias metrics.

### 5.2 Algorithmic Transparency

Users will be informed about:

*   The specific facial recognition models used.
*   The accuracy and reliability of these models.
*   Known limitations and potential sources of error.
*   How to report concerns about misidentifications or bias.

## 6. Third-Party Integrations and Data Sharing

### 6.1 Manus AI Integration

The project will integrate Manus AI for advanced AI assistant capabilities. Data sharing with Manus AI will be governed by:

*   **Data Minimization:** Only non-sensitive, aggregated data will be shared with Manus AI.
*   **Contractual Safeguards:** A Data Processing Agreement (DPA) will establish Manus AI as a data processor, bound by the same data protection standards.

*   **Vendor Assessment:** All vendors will be evaluated for data protection compliance.
*   **Data Processing Agreements:** Formal DPAs will be established with all vendors.
*   **User Notification:** Users will be informed about third-party integrations.
*   **Data Minimization:** Only necessary data will be shared with third parties.

## 7. Data Subject Rights

### 7.1 Right to Access

Users can request access to all personal data processed about them. Requests will be fulfilled within 30 days (or as required by applicable law) in a commonly used electronic format.

### 7.2 Right to Rectification

Users can request correction of inaccurate personal data. The system will provide mechanisms to flag and correct misidentifications.

### 7.3 Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten")

Users can request deletion of their facial embeddings and associated data. Upon request, all data will be deleted within 30 days, and deletion will be confirmed to the user.

### 7.4 Right to Restrict Processing

Users can request that processing of their data be restricted. The system will maintain the data but cease active processing until the restriction is lifted.

### 7.5 Right to Data Portability

Users can request their data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. This will enable users to transfer their data to other systems.

### 7.6 Right to Object

Users can object to processing of their data for specific purposes. The system will cease processing for those purposes upon objection.

## 8. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

A comprehensive DPIA has been conducted for the facial recognition component of the system. Key findings:

**Risk Assessment:**

*   **High Risk:** Facial recognition processing is inherently high-risk due to the sensitive nature of biometric data and potential for discrimination.
*   **Mitigation Measures:** Exclusive use of public data sources, bias mitigation, transparency, and user consent significantly reduce risk.
*   **Residual Risk:** Low residual risk after mitigation measures are implemented.

**Consultation:**

The DPIA will be shared with relevant data protection authorities and stakeholders for feedback.

## 9. Incident Response and Breach Notification

### 9.1 Data Breach Response Plan

In the event of a data breach affecting facial recognition or OSINT data:

*   **Immediate Response:** Isolate affected systems and assess the scope of the breach.
